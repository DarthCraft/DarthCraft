# DarthCraftMod Plugin

### Project Overview

The DarthCraftMod plugin is designed to add minor yet effective game changing improvements to further enhance the player experience for all member of the DarthCraft community. This plugin is designed with our players and administrators in mind and aims to make it as easy as possible for everyone to use the features that they need the most for the best survival experience.

### License

We have a very clear license currently being actively worked on that will give you all the things you can and cannot do with the projects in general. You can find this [here](https://github.com/Superior-Development/License) and there will be a project specific licence published for additional restrictions / waivers published to this repository in the near future. 

### Requirements

This plugin is built for a Spigot Server from 1.8 onwards. You are able to look back to a previous commit for previous versions, however you will loose out on the new features we are adding. We will only support the version that is currently being ran on the [DarthCraft Server](http://www.darthcraft.net) so we urge you to take some time to understand the inner workings of the project before attempting to backdate features for previous MC versions. 

DCMod also has a hard dependency on Votifier due to the custom voting features that we have implemented into the project. While the long term goal is to allow the plugin to work without this, as of this commit it is still a required dependency.

You will also require the following libraries / plugins to actually build this plugin:

 - BukkitLib (Just to build the plugin - It is built into DCMod when built)
 - Spigot (Just to build the plugin - You will need to be running it on your server anyway)
 - MaxMindGEOIP Custom Dependency (Just to build the plugin - It is built into DCMod when built)
 
The MaxMindGEOIP Custom dependency is not currently available to be downloaded, however can be sent on request. Please email [admin@superior-networks.com](mailto:admin@superior-networks.com) and we can have the jar file sent through to you. 

### SQL Support

DarthCraftMod supports MySQL only at the current time. It is currently in its early development stages and may break stuff that we are not aware of. If you find an issue with it, please open an [issue](https://github.com/DarthCraft/DarthCraft/issues) including all the applicable logs and further information that we may need to resolve the issue.

### How can I help and contribute to the plugin?

Depending on your knowledge of Java you may decide that you are able to help us in the patching of bugs and implementation of features. If this sounds like the sort of thing that you would be interested in, please see [this thread](https://www.darthcraft.net/forums/showthread.php?tid=2369) and then contact Wild1145 on the forums for further information. Successful developers will be given access to show what they know and eventually full pull and push access to the repository, and eventual extensive access to the server its self. 

If you are somewhat less knowledgeable in Java, you can still help! We are looking for people who are able to report issues, help keep issues clean and updated, and people who can play in game to test out any issues that are reported. Suggesting and commenting on new features is also something that is vital to us improving, and by doing that you will help shape the community.

Regardless of where you decide you would like to help, reading our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/DarthCraft/DarthCraft/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) is absolutly vital to ensure clear and accurate communication between all involved persons of the devleopment cycle.
